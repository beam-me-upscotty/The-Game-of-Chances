# Game
An android game on Rock-Paper-scissor, Coin toss and Dice roll...

I created this app to learn the concept of fragments in android 
and to apply use them as tabs in a ViewPager

The project has only one activity

  GameHolder.MainActivity
 
with support of 

  GameHolder.gamePagerAdapter
  ( to implement tabular layouts at a swipe )

the Adapter works with three fragments in 3 packages respectively
Ropapors
Dice
Coin

Ropapors is an example of multiple fragments in a single fragment
whereas 
Dice & Coin
have one Fragment each for their functioning.
